        <div class="introduction-text">
            <p><p>I am a creative engineer with an interest in (soft) robotics, specializing in user-friendly interfaces, automation and playful interactions that blend functionality with an engaging experience. Driven by a hands-on and user-centred approach, I am passionate about turning ideas into tangible solutions that meet the stakeholder‚Äôs requirements. With my enthusiastic and approachable character, I foster a risk-taking and open environment, that encourages collaboration and innovation.</p>
<p>In my work, I don&rsquo;t just follow the status quo. I thrive on pushing boundaries and questioning norms to uncover new pathways to innovation and novelty. Whether leading the team or providing a fresh perspective from an oppositional stance, my projects will always be packed with lots of fun, passion and risk.</p>
<p>I believe my strongest asset as a designer is my character. I am always full of positive energy and couldn‚Äôt live without lots of humor in my team. I always strive for an open an honest atmosphere in my group, to foster trust and equal communication, that I believe sparks the best projects and memories within those.</p>

            <h1>My LEGO journey (from tinkerer to engineer)</h1>
            
            <p>From the age of 10 I loved building my own complex and embedded LEGO machines from scratch. Lego building has taught me a lot that I benefit from as an Industrial Design student. </p>
            <br>
            
            <p></p>
            <br>
            
            <p>Thinking ahead on the functionalities of the various mechanisms, how the machine should be built in sequential layers, and how sensors and actuators could be used to develop meaningful experiences, all helped me get an insight into the engineering side of things. I believe this is where my passion for prototyping was sparked and why I am good at it. </p>
            <br>
            
            <p></p>
            <br>
            
            <p>Building these machines also taught me how to work systematically and for the first time I touched upon iterative design: in my experiences, the first version of an intended mechanism does not work perfectly the first time, and you have to tweak and try out features over and over again. This taught me to be resilient, as building such machines can take forever and requires a lot of perseverance to overcome the vast amount of failures. </p>
            <br>
            
            <p></p>
            <br>
            
            <p>What better way to transform a passion into your profession. I think my experiences as a LEGO creator have been a great jumping board for diving into the study of Industrial Design and I am glad these skills have been proven useful during my bachelor‚Äôs.</p>

                <p>I was tired of constantly having to hold an egg in order to paint it. That‚Äôs why I made this machine in which you can strap the egg just tight enough so the egg stays in place but doesn‚Äôt brake. The LEGO Technic motor will make the egg rotate very fast. Now you can simply put a pen through the whole an create beautiful eastereggs to hide them in your garden. </p>

You can throw in a 1 Euro coin at the top and balls will be dispensed. By pulling an elastic lever, you can shoot the ball upwards. You have double flippers, elastic bands for the excitement and even a rail that goes over the whole thing. Enough elements that make it one of the coolest projects I have made so far.</p>

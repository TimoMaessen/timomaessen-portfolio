what = """
This projectâ€™s primary objective was to design, fabricate, and demonstrate a microfluidic valve prototype.
Nine microvalve principles were evaluated, considering factors like precision, response times, robustness,
and ease of manufacturing. Based on these evaluations, we selected a pneumatic microvalve with a thin
PDMS membrane. This design provides rapid, precise control over fluid flow, compatible with water, and is
energy-efficient.

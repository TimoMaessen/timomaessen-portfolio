what = """
Literature on personal informatics (PI) systems highlights the potential benefits of self-tracking for well-being. However, many existing systems limit these benefits, by imposing predefined goals on the users. This project contributes to a paradigm shift towards non- judgemental interfaces by developing a non-judgemental PI system for tracking and interacting with breathing data. This project, therefore, employs the data-enabled design process, focusing on exploration, rather than behavioral change. The chosen context of breathing tracking is explored through the design and deployment of technologies for measuring, visualizing and interacting with breathing data. A creative approach was taken in analysing the data, leading to insights on the preferred location and time of use, the usability of the system, and data physicalization. Additionally, concerns for these systems are argued for. Ultimately, this project bridges the gaps in PI literature and design practices by utilizing dynamic data physicalization and data-enabled design principles.

what = """
The diffuser houses 5 scents that the user can manually choose which scent they want to smell throughout the day.  What is unique is that it also learns from the input of the user. If there is a scent that the user usually chooses or avoids, the diffuser registers this into the user profile and adjusts the ease of turning. This makes the preferred scents easy to turn to, while the avoided scents are harder to rotate to. The diffuser also learns during which times of the day the users usually change scent. It signals through wiggling to the user when it is usually time to change scent. The diffuser can further learn this by connecting to the userâ€™s calendar.

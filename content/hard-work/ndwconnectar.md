what = """
In close collaboration with Ephi/NDW, a company that deploys industrial roller belts for boxes, palets and more, I developed an AR maintenance app that provides utilities for performing maintenance on these roller belts. This app builds upon NDW Connect, an already existing concept.
 NDW Connect AR is a user-friendly and intuitive maintenance app with AR at its basis. The app aids the user in three ways: (1) In the app, the user can adjust the movement such as direction or speed of the individual track segments. (2) In the app, the user has an overview of the trackâ€™s data such as runTime. (3) In the app, the user can add maintenance logs to keep track of all activities performed on the individual segments. 

This app has been fully developed in C# in Unity3D, with VSCode as code editor and Git to save all iterations on the code. Models and sprites have been developed in Blender and Figma.

Paper aeroplanes. Who hasn't folded them? These 'Paper Trails', by the talented group Wayfinders - part of student team IGNITE - move naturally with you. From light artwork to light artwork. You will find them atop lampposts, high along the pavement and in front of you exercising in the street. It brings a nostalgia and playfulness that you normally see with children playing in the street. Without the usual cues like arrows and signs, they manage to find a magical and effective way to guide visitors through the route. And they do so without obscuring the street scene. 'Visitors don't realise they are following Paper Trails, but without this signing they could still get lost,' the team explains. 'An aeroplane symbolises taking people to sought-after locations. It always takes you further.'

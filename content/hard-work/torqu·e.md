what = """
In this research project, I delved into the transformative potential of force-feedback in control interfaces for remote arc-welding robots. This research explores how different levels of force-feedback—submissive, assistive, and dominant—affect task performance and user experience in contexts as trajectory adherence and situation awareness.

By providing intuitive and responsive feedback, TORQUE aims to enhance precision and spatial understanding, paving the way for more efficient and user-friendly robotic control systems. Discover how innovative haptic technology can revolutionize remote human-robot interactions.
